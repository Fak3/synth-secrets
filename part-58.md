# Synthesizing The Rest Of The Hammond Organ: Part 2  
_Original article: [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb04/articles/synthsecrets.htm][0]_

As with so much surrounding the Hammond organ, there's much more to the Leslie rotary speaker than meets the eye, and synthesizing its effects involves considerably more than just adding vibrato, as we find out this month... This is the 58th article in a 63-part series. Read [all parts][1].

For three months, we've been investigating the sound of the Hammond organ, spending two of those months recreating the sound of the tonewheel generator, and a third attempting somewhat less successfully to emulate the onboard effects provided by 'the real thing'. But, as we all know, the classic jazz/rock/pop organ sound is as much a consequence of a rotary speaker as it is of the organ itself. So, in this fourth article dedicated to understanding and synthesizing the organ, we're going to concentrate on the physics and sound of the 'Leslie' speaker.

A Brief Description

What we now recognise as the rotary speaker did not materialise as a fully developed concept overnight. In an effort to animate the sound of the Hammond electromechanical organ, Don Leslie had been experimenting with all manner of systems before he alighted upon what he called a 'Vibratone Speaker', but which is what we now call the classic, twin-rotor 'Leslie'. One of his early experiments was a monstrosity with 14 speakers mounted inside a rotating drum. Fortunately, while paring his ideas down to a manageable size and complexity, Leslie found that just two speakers (mounted inside a cabinet, as shown above) generated the most pleasing sound. One of these was a treble unit that produced the frequencies above 800Hz, and which played upward into what looks like two rotating horns (although one of these is a dummy, provided only to stop the whole assembly from shaking itself to bits). The second was a bass speaker reproducing frequencies below 800Hz, played downwards into the single rotating 'rotor' (see Figure 1, below).

Leslie provided each speaker assembly with two rotation speeds --- one slow and one fast --- that he called 'chorale' and 'tremolo', respectively. The rotor's chorale speed was different from the horn's, as was its tremolo speed, and the transition rates between slow and fast (and _vice versa_) were different for the two assemblies. The result of playing a sound through this device was, therefore, a complex effect that combined pitch modulation, amplitude modulation, tone modulation, and reverberation (ie. the effect of the enclosed cabinet), with the high frequencies and low frequencies swirling around independently to create a very pleasing and expansive sound. What's more, Leslie found that, by placing the cabinet close to a wall or to the corner of a room, he could use the additional reflections from those surfaces to obtain a stereo field from a single, monophonic source.

Nowadays, there are dozens of models of Leslie speaker, and numerous physical as well as electronic imitations. Some Leslies have single rotors, but the sound produced by these is inferior to that offered by the larger, dual-rotor models characterised in Figure 1\. Others are built into their host organs; a common example is the single-rotor unit found within the Hammond T500-series organs from the mid-1970s. And, of course, no modern organ emulation could be considered complete without the inclusion of a digital recreation of the Leslie speaker effect.

But how many of us fully understand how the Leslie creates its instantly recognisable sound? Ask many keyboard players what makes the device so special, and they will usually offer an answer that includes the words 'Doppler effect'. They are right to do so --- the Doppler effect can explain a significant element of the sound generated by the Leslie. However, if you then ask what the Doppler effect is, you will often be met with a blank stare. What's more, this is only _part_ of the story, as we shall now see...

The Doppler Effect

Christian Johann Doppler was a scientist who died as long ago as 1853, yet he explained something that we all experience; the fact that, when something emitting a sound is moving towards us, we perceive a higher pitch than when the same sound is moving away from us. To understand why this is the case, we'll start by following Doppler's line of thinking, and consider an archetypically 19th-century mode of transport: a ship.
