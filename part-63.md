_Original article: [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul04/articles/synthsecrets.htm][0]_

After over five years, Synth Secrets reaches its conclusion (and conclusions!). Will we ever look at synthesis in quite the same way again? This is the last article in a 63-part series. Read [all parts][1].

Every few weeks, my colleagues at _Sound On Sound_ and I receive a telephone call or email demanding to know which is the best synthesizer. When these requests come directly to me, I have often replied, asking the enquirer what he (it's invariably a he) wants to achieve, and what criteria he deems to contribute to the term 'best'. And, every time I do, the response is, "Look, never mind all that... just tell me which one is best. I know _you_ know --- why won't you tell me?"
