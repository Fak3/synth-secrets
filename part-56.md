# Synthesizing Tonewheel Organs: Part2  
_Original article: [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/dec03/articles/synthsecrets.htm][0]_

If you followed last month's advice, you'll know how to synthesize a basic Hammond tone on a Roland Juno 6\. But can the same technique be applied to any other synth? This is the 56th article in a 63-part series. Read [all parts][1].

You may recall that last month, I described how, many years ago, I embarked upon a quest to find an affordable and manageable synthesizer to replace my ageing Crumar Organiser and Korg BX3\. I left you with the solution I found, a Hammond patch created on a Roland Juno 6 (shown here as Figure 1 below). If you refer back to last month's article, you'll remember that the harmonic spectrum of this patch is as shown in Figure 2, where the three red squares represent the amplitudes of the first --- and only --- three harmonics present in the sound; the basis for a fine emulation of the 88 8000 000 registration. (For an explanation of the curious axes on the graph in Figure 2, and why they are particularly well suited to depicting the harmonic spectrum of the output from a tonewheel organ, I again refer you back to last month's instalment of this series).

Now, you might think that these diagrams reveal the secret for synthesizing all manner of Hammond registrations on the Juno. After all, the self-oscillating VCF --- which is responsible for the presence of the third harmonic --- can be tuned to any frequency, so in theory, we should be able to create any patch that uses three drawbars, provided that two of them, those generated by the sub-oscillator and the main DCO, are an octave apart.

For example, if we slide the VCF cutoff up to the next drawbar frequency (the fourth harmonic of the fundamental, which is the 4' drawbar) we obtain strong components at the first, second and fourth harmonics, with a reduced contribution from the third harmonic; maybe something along the lines of an 82 8800 000 registration. But when we try this, something doesn't sound quite right. While the basic tonality is much as you might expect, the patch is too bright, and lacks the character of half a hundredweight of pickups, valve preamps, and rotating steel.

To explain this, I've calculated the amplitudes of the frequencies present in the new patch, and shown the results in Figure 3 (above). As you can see, the first four harmonics are present in the expected amounts, but three more --- which I have shown in orange --- are also present, albeit at lower amplitudes. We might be able to excuse the rightmost of these because it lies on the eighth harmonic, and therefore represents a bit of leakage from the 2' drawbar. But the contributions from the fifth and seventh harmonics are not so welcome. They don't sound 'wrong' exactly --- after all, they lie in their correct positions in a perfect harmonic series --- but their contributions are inappropriate, and it is these that make the patch sound too bright (the 6th harmonic is entirely absent, but I'll leave you to work out why).

The situation deteriorates further if we raise the cutoff frequency any more. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the filter passes all the harmonics that lie below the cutoff frequency. This is no good because, as shown last month, the idealised spectrum generated by the Hammond tonewheel engine --- which goes as high as the 16th harmonic of the 16' drawbar --- does not include the fifth, seventh, ninth, 11th, 13th, 14th or 15th harmonics. Secondly, the densely packed higher harmonics are not attenuated as rapidly as the widely spaced lower harmonics, so we hear many overtones above the cutoff frequency of the self-oscillating filter.

To demonstrate this dramatically, I have calculated 80 8000 008 as recreated by the 'Juno method' as described last month. This is a perfectly acceptable Hammond registration which, when patched on the synth, is a sonic mess. Again, the desired harmonics are shown in red (see Figure 4, above), and the unwanted ones in orange. As you can imagine, it sounds nothing like the real thing.

If this weren't bad enough, the tracking of the Juno's filter becomes very unstable at higher frequencies. It is superb at low multiples of the fundamental because it 'locks onto' the strong second, third and (just about) fourth harmonics, producing a pure, stable tone at pitches that relate precisely to the 8', 5 2/3' and 4' drawbars. But as the harmonic number rises, its ability to lock on diminishes, and it starts to float around. The result is a strange, tuned noise that is interesting, but nothing whatsoever to do with the sound of a Hammond organ. When it comes to the crunch, the 'Juno method' is capable only of synthesizing the 88 8000 000 registration with any degree of realism. So perhaps we should now look elsewhere to synthesize a more flexible imitation of the Hammond.
