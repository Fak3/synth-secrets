# Synthesizing Tonewheel Organs  
_Original article: [http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov03/articles/synthsecrets.htm][0]_

Long before Bob Moog built his first synth, there was the Hammond tonewheel organ; effectively an additive synthesizer, albeit electromechanical rather than electronic. So emulating a Hammond with an analogue synth shouldn't be too hard, right? Well... This is the 55th article in a 63-part series. Read [all parts][1].

Long before Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman showed us that keyboard players did not have to be accompanists dressed in black and illuminated by black spotlights, and even longer before musicians began to take to the stage armed with nothing but a laptop computer and a pair of turntables, jazz and blues organists were the hi-tech musicians of their day. So when players such as Jimmy Smith and Earl Grant cast off their sackcloth and made a bee-line for the front of the stage, they did so with nary a Minimoog, ARP 2600, EMS VCS3, chorus unit, phaser, ensemble, or digital reverb in sight --- which isn't surprising, as none of these had yet been invented. With no more than a Hammond organ, a bit of spring reverb, and maybe a touch of overdrive, these guys were creating exciting new forms of dance music throughout the middle of the 20th century. In retrospect, it's far from unreasonable to suggest that almost all modern forms of hi-tech music evolved from the 'black' music of the 1940s and 1950s, and it is therefore appropriate to hand the award for most influential keyboard instrument of the 20th Century to the Hammond 'tonewheel' organ.

A Course In Electromechanics

Like many brilliant ideas, the basis of Laurens Hammond's tonewheel generator is simple: a knobbly wheel rotates in the presence of a magnet, and the resulting changes in the magnetic field induce a signal in a pickup (see Figure 1, below). The waveform and frequency of the signal is determined by the shape of the wheel and the number of 'bumps' that pass the tip of the magnet every second. Given that in the finished instrument, all the tonewheels are mounted on a single axle, different frequencies are obtained not by using different rotation speeds, but by using tonewheels of different sizes and geometries. Like I said... brilliant!

When designing his organ, Hammond decided that each tonewheel should generate a sound as close as possible to a sine wave, so that players could construct timbres using a fundamental and overtones. Building on this idea, he chose a system by which players could mix up to nine sine waves simultaneously, using 'drawbars' (see Figure 2) to give each an amplitude ranging from zero to eight. Some later Hammonds offered more drawbars, and some offered fewer, but nine is the classic configuration.
